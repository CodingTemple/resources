UNIX systems are considered ideal by many programmers for software development for a variety of reasons. However, the lion's share of computer users use Windows. If you are a software developer running on a Windows OS, you are likely to eventually run into limitations with the Command Line Interfaces (CLIs), namely, Windows Command Prompt (cmd) and Windows PowerShell.

Installing Linux onto your computer is not necessarily an enormous commitment, but it's not exactly trivial, either. If you are interested in messing around with the functionality of UNIX's "Bash" CLI without necessarily committing to a hard drive partition or total replacement of your Windows OS with Linux, Windows Subsystem for Linux is a great option and is not difficult to install.

## Installing Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows 10 or 11
